## ðŸŒŒ **Solution for Activity List 01**

### âœ¨ Overview

This repository contains the solution for **Activity List 01**, which is part of the course **Object-Oriented Programming**. This course is taught by Professor **Roger Moura Sarmento** at the IFCE campus in Maranguape.

The exercises in this list were designed to enhance the understanding and practical application of object-oriented programming principles, allowing students to bridge the gap between theoretical concepts and their practical implementation. Each activity aims to foster a hands-on learning experience, promoting deeper insight into the fundamentals of object-oriented programming.
