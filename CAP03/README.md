# Java Programming Solutions and Algorithm Fundamentals

This repository contains solutions to a series of programming problems in **Java**, focusing on fundamental concepts of algorithm design and data structures. Each problem is presented with a brief description of its functionality, along with a direct link to the corresponding code. The problems are designed to help practice programming skills and logical reasoning, with an emphasis on using **sequential structures** to efficiently solve tasks.

In addition to the Java solutions, the repository also introduces basic concepts of **algorithm structures** and **Pascal programming**, such as variable declaration, value assignment, and input/output operations. These fundamentals are essential for developing robust programs and understanding how different programming languages handle the construction of both simple and complex algorithms.

**Resolution of the Exercises Solved from CHAPTER 03 - SEQUENTIAL STRUCTURE of the book FUNDAMENTALS OF COMPUTER PROGRAMMING by authors Ana F. G. Ascencio and Edilene A. V. de Campos. 📚**
